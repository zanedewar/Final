  <h3>Inital Portfolio/ Resume</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/Project1/project1" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/Project1/project1">Isabella Mankis Portfolio</a><br>
	<p>My first portfolio in an HTML format was, as anyone can plainly see, incredibly basic. 
	This project is a great way to see how much I have learned over the course of one summer quarter.
	Although there is nothing wrong with this project in the sense that I could use this as a portfolio, it is simple compared to what I am now capable of.
	If I were to do this project again, I would make many changes, but, I am still proud of the work I created when I knew nothing about HTML formatting.</p>
  <h3>Amazon Rainforest Deforestation</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/lab2/lab2_home.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/lab2/lab2_home.html">Amazon Deforestation information</a><br>
	<p>On this website, you'll find information about the Amazon Rainforest Deforestation, why it's an issue we should be aware of, how to help at home, and how to get more information.
	This project is slightly more complex but still basic compared to some of my other work.
	I was actually very happy to create this website as it expanded my knowledge about the Amazon Rainforest Deforestation as well as expanding my knowledge about HTML design.</p>
  <h3>Menu items</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/menu/menu.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/menu/menu.html">Bistro blog menu</a><br>
	<p>On this assignment, I created a menu for a website that unfortunately is misaligned, but other than that has no issues. 
	This assignment taught me more about designing of text and CSS work. There were a couple of moments of frustration in this assignment but overall it turned out well.</p>
  <h3>Burgers, Burgers, and no more burgers.</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/Burger/hamburger.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/Burger/hamburger.html">Burger construction menu</a><br>
	<p>On the Burger menu, this was again centered around CSS rather than just HTML. 
	I was interested at the assingment and it taught me about the separate CSS page as well as how to change the colors of things. 
	The ingredients themselves, I did not format, but, the rest of the website was myself.</p>
  <h3>Madrid, Spain</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/Madrid/Madrid.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/Madrid/Madrid.html">The basics for the new Madrid tourist</a><br>
	<p>My Madrid website was a true turning point in my learning.
	If you were to look at the website, you would be able to see the slideshow created at the top of the page.
	At this point in my learning, I was able to expand into other areas of HTML that were of interest to myself.
	The assignment used to create this website called for 4 pictures of the attractions I would describe on the page.
	I had decided that it was worth it to me to figure out how to create a slideshow because I really like websites that have slideshows.
	It was very challenging but worth it.</p>
  <h3>Wizard Of Oz Chapters 1-3</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/WizardOfOz/wizard_of_oz.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/WizardOfOz/wizard_of_oz.html">Chapters 1-3 of the Wizard of Oz</a><br>
	<p>I appreciated this assignment as this, again, presented a new challenge.
	The assignment was all about CSS and had to include pictures.
	I decided to try to be inventive with the assignment and use the images as the background.
	I have seen this before with websites about books or stories and it seems to work well within those sites.
	I believe my mistake with this was not making the pictures faded enough as they can get in the way of what's being read.
	Other than that, I'm very happy with the site I created.</p>
  <h3>Multimedia page: Most impactful videos of all time</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/multimedia/multimedia.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/multimedia/multimedia.html">Videos that shook the internet</a><br>
	<p>On this site, you'll find 3 videos that I have found to be especially impactful.
	I appreciated this assingment for many reasons.
	First, I love the medium of video as an art form which makes this assignment incredibly interesting to me.
	Second, I have researched this videos in the past so I was already prepared for what was being asked.
	Lastly, I learned how to create a gradient background which is my favorite background for any presentation.
	I find it to be subtly stylish.</p>
  <h3>The Optimist: the daily news with a positive spin</h3>
	<a href="https://zanedewar.github.io/Landingpage/landing_page.html" target="https://zanedewar.github.io/Landingpage/landing_page.html">The Optimist News</a><br>
	<p>The Optimist is a news subscription that provides good news to anyone that signs up.
	On this website, you can see that I have created a form for user's to fill out before moving on to the next page.
	Everything within this site was created by myself from the code, to the logo, and the mock-up.
	I'm truly proud of this project as it has been my best yet. 
	There are still things I would like to change but don't necessarily know how.
	Overall, I'm happy with the work I put forward as I know it's the best I could have done.</p>
